# What is the next layer to deposit? — the merge half of REQ-ROLLING-001.
#
# When a scan proposal is MERGED, the signed deposit runs. The deposit workflow
# takes the layer identifier and the monotonic per-line counter as dispatch
# inputs, which a human typed for the four layers published so far. Typing them
# is toil; choosing them is not judgement, because the published record already
# determines the answer — and getting them wrong is unrecoverable, since varve
# has neither revocation nor rotation and a layer id, once published, is spent.
#
# So this reads the answer out of the registry instead of guessing it:
#
#   layer   = <line>.<P>   where line is the current UTC YYYY.MM and P is one
#                          past the highest P already published on that line
#                          (0 when the line is new).
#   counter = one past the counter in the highest published layer's baseline
#             line-status on that line (1 when the line is new). Counters are
#             per line and must only ever increase — an anti-rollback record
#             that went backwards would let an old layer masquerade as current.
#
# It is deliberately fail-loud. If the registry cannot be read, or the computed
# tag already exists, it refuses rather than proposing an id that would collide
# with a published layer.
#
# Copied from pulseengine/varve, where it was written for the depositor that
# used to live there. The realm's own tooling belongs with the realm (varve
# DD-027, DD-028), and it is the AUTONOMOUS scanner in this repository that
# depends on it now: nobody types a layer id here any more, so the derivation
# has to be right without a person to notice it is not.
#
# Usage:  tools/next-layer-id.sh [registry-ref]
# Prints: "<layer>\t<counter>"  (and a human-readable trace on stderr)
#
# Reads the registry anonymously — layer publication is public and the whole
# point of the record is that anyone can check it. A token is used if
# GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN is set, which is what makes this work for a private
# realm too.
